## How to run

We recommend that you create a virtual environment to run the following notebooks before running the following commands. The notebooks run on 3.5 and later (tested). It probably works on 3.4.

### Install 

```bash
# Install the python libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the jupyter extensions
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
```

Then, run `jupyter notebooks` and go to http://localhost:8888/nbextensions/?nbextension=zenmode/main where you enable `Table of Contents (2)`

### Run

To run, simply type in the terminal `jupyter notebook` and open one of them !
